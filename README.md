# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. After finding the results we will write a report that summarizes our analysis and helps prepare our manager for the "silver tsunami" as many current employees reach retirement age. 

This project consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report. We will submit the following:
* Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
* Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
* Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis (README.md)

### Results
The following table shows the number of retiring employees and their position titles. 
[retiring_titles.csv](https://github.com/kjuneja/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/files/6951375/retiring_titles.csv)

The following table shows the employees who are eligible for mentorship program. 
[mentorship_eligibilty.csv](https://github.com/kjuneja/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/files/6951378/mentorship_eligibilty.csv)

Using the above tables as reference we can provide four major points that would be helpful to the company

1. The most retiring people are the Senior Engineer and Senior Staff members.
2. The above informations tells us that the company needs to pritorize the hiring for these positions first.
3. There are about 1,549 employees that are eligible for the mentorship program.
4. There are more people retiring from the those who are eligible for the mentorship program. 

These are some of the facts that we can gather and this should help the compant to create a better program where they can train the people to fill the positions. 

### Summary
The tables that we created shows the clear picture of the people that are going to retire and people eligible for mentorship program. 

The following answer to these questions can provide us with more insight to the upcoming "silver tsunami"

1. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
   - There are about 90,398 employees who are about to retire so we would atleast need half of the people from the total no of employees retiring. 

2. Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
   - There are only 1,549 employees that are eligible for mentorship program and the company needs to hire a lot of employees, so we would need more mentors to train the new hires. 

As we know that there are many employees that about to retire and we do not have enough mentors to train we can create a new query that can give us the number of people retiring in each year and specially we can see how many are going to retire this year or the upcoming years. This will help the company to focus on which role to fill quickly and could train accordingly. We could also create a table to group the eligible mentors to their titles and we can have an idea which posotion would need more mentors and could help ease the hiring process.
